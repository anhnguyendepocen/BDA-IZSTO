## A motivating example: paratuberculosis
- Caused by __Mycobacterium avium__ subspecies __paratuberculosis__
- Granulomatous enteritis - malabsorption - diarrhoea - weight loss - death
- Disease seen worldwide in ruminants
- No effective treatment
- In deer, highest clinical incidence is in yearlings

## The problem

- _Aim_: estimate sensitivity and specificity of individual faecal culture (IFC) and a serum ELISA test for paratuberculosis in deer

- There is no __gold standard__ test in the live animal

## Latent class amalysis

- True disease/infection status of individual is accepted as unknown (latent)

- Test accuracy is derived mathematically from test results using maximum likelihood methods or Bayesian inference

## Advantage of latent class amalysis

- New test for evaluation may be more sensitive than the existing gold standard
- Avoids selection of panel of _true positives_ biased to those positive to a gold standard
- If Bayesian methods are used to fit the model, smaller sample size needed

## Two test-two population method

- S.L.Hui, S.D. Walter, Biometrics 36, 167-171 (1980)
    - consider two tests  applied simultaneously to the same individuals from two populations with different disease prevalences
    - assume conditional independence of the errors of the two tests
    - _then_: the error rates of both tests and the true prevalences in both populations can be estimated by a maximum likelihood procedure

## Two test-two population method assumption

- Test sensitivity and specificity are constant across populations
- The disease prevalences of the two populations are distinct


## Bayes Theorem in test diagnostic

- _Prior information_: test operative characteristics and prevalence 
- _Data_: the test results 
- _Aim_: to derive the posterior probability for each parameter

## Informative Priors

- Elicit most plausible value (e.g specificity of test A is 90%) 
- Elicit value that you are 95% sure the value exceeds certain threshold 
    - e.g. 95% certain that specificity is greater than 70%
- Translate these into a beta distribution

## Priors....

Different ways to build prior distribution $Beta(\alpha,\beta)$ for $\pi$:

- Building priors solely on the prior parameters and interpreting $\alpha + \beta$ as the total number of subjects (Gelman):
    - $\alpha$ successes and $\beta$ failures

- Using 90th percent probability interval $W_{90} = (5th, 95th)$-percentiles and elicit information from investigators or past studies through the percentile approach


Informative and non-informative priors

- __Informative priors__ are narrow and reflect the knowledge of strong prior information
- __Non-informative priors__ are flat and reflect little prior information


## Prior elicitation
Two steps for eliciting a-priori distribution

1. eliciting the center value by asking the clinician "what is the most likely response reate you expect to occur?"
    - finding out whether the response is the mean, median or the mode
2. assessing the uncertainty in the "most likely response rate" 
    - elicitation of $W_{90}$ is easy for clinicians who think in terms of percentiles
    - $W_{90}$ can be elicited by asking clinicians how uncertain they are regarding their center value
    - for mode answer, the question can be posed as "prior sample size" (increasing or decreasing $\alpha + \beta$)


## How to build priors

1. __mode (non-informative):__ 

	+ it has prior parameters $\alpha = \pi_{prior}+1$ and $\beta = 1-\pi_{prior}+1$
	+ it has the interpretation of a mode and a prior sample size of $\alpha+\beta=3$
				
2. 	__mode (informative):__ 

	+ it has prior parameters $\alpha = \pi_{prior}+1+n_{prior}\pi_{prior}$ and $\beta = 1-\pi_{prior}+1+n_{prior}(1-\pi_{prior})$
	+ it has the interpretation of a mode and a prior sample size of $\alpha+\beta=n_{prior}+3$


## How to build priors

3. 	__median (informative):__ 

	+  we elicit $\pi_{prior}$ assuming it is the _median_ and we elicit also $W_{90}$
	+ this requires solving the system:
	
$$
F(\pi_{prior}\vert\alpha\beta) =0.5 \\
F^{-1}(0.95\vert\alpha\beta) -F^{-1}(0.05\vert\alpha\beta) = W_{90} 
$$


4. __mean (informative):__ 

	+  we elicit $\pi_{prior}$ assuming it is the _mean_ and we elicit also $W_{90}$
	+ this requires solving the system:
	
$$
E(y)=\pi_{prior} \\
F^{-1}(0.95\vert\alpha\beta) -F^{-1}(0.05\vert\alpha\beta) = W_{90} 
$$


## $alpha$ and $beta$ parameters calculation

```{r}
source('R\\informativePriors.R')
```

- Parameters calculation using the __informative median__ prior:
 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pparameter(pi=0.2, w90=0.3, prior.method='median-informative')
```

## $alpha$ and $beta$ parameters calculation

- Parameters calculation using the __informative mean__ prior:
 
 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pparameter(pi=0.2, w90=0.3, prior.method='mean-informative')

```

## $alpha$ and $beta$ parameters calculation

- Parameters calculation using the __informative mode__ prior:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pparameter(pi=0.2, w90=0.3, prior.method='mode-informative')
```

## Latent class analysis

- For each cell, the _likelihood_ is computed

<center>
<img src="images\twoTP2.png" width="200">
</center>

- Test result (a) (animal positive on both test) occurs if the animale is a _true positive $(T^+)$_ or a _false positive $(F^+)$_

$$
\textrm P(\textrm T^+) = \textrm P(\textrm T_1^+ \cap \textrm T_2^+) =  \textrm P(\textrm T_1^+\vert \textrm M)\times \textrm P(\textrm T_2^+\vert \textrm M) \times \textrm P(\textrm M) 
$$
$$
\textrm P(\textrm F^+) = \textrm P(\textrm T_1^+ \cap \textrm T_2^+) =  \textrm P(\textrm T_1^+\vert \textrm S)\times \textrm P(\textrm T_2^+\vert \textrm S) \times \textrm P(\textrm S) 
$$

## Latent class analysis

- For cell (a), the likelihood is the sum of these probabilities

$$
\textrm P(\textrm A= \textrm a) = \underbrace{\textrm {prevalence} \times \textrm{SE}_1\times \textrm{SE}_2}_{\textrm P(\textrm T^+)} + \underbrace{
(1- \textrm {prevalence} )\times (1- \textrm {SP}_1 ) \times (1- \textrm {SP}_2 )}_{\textrm P(\textrm F^+)}
$$
- Likelihoods for remaining cells are constructed similarly

## Latent class analysis

- Population 1
$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{Cell a: } & p_1SE_1SE_2 + (1-p_1)(1-SP_1)(1-SP_2)\\
\textrm{Cell b: } & p_1SE_1(1-SE_2) + (1-p_1)(1-SP_1)SP_2\\
\textrm{Cell c: } & p_1(1-SE_1)SE_2 + (1-p_1)SP_1(1-SP_2)\\
\textrm{Cell d: } & p_1(1-SE_1)(1-SE_2) + (1-p_1)SP_1SP_2\\
\end{align}
$$
- Population 2
$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{Cell e: } & p_2SE_1SE_2 + (1-p_2)(1-SP_1)(1-SP_2)\\
\textrm{Cell f: } & p_2SE_1(1-SE_2) + (1-p_2)(1-SP_1)SP_2\\
\textrm{Cell g: } & p_2(1-SE_1)SE_2 + (1-p_2)SP_1(1-SP_2)\\
\textrm{Cell h: } & p_2(1-SE_1)(1-SE_2) + (1-p_2)SP_1SP_2\\
\end{align}
$$

## Latent class analysis

- Six parameters can be estimated from the observed data
    - prevalence in population 1 $(p_1)$ and in population 2 $(p_2)$
    - sensitivity of test 1 (ELISA) and test 2 (IFC)
    - specificity of test 1 (ELISA) and test 2 (IFC)


## Objective

- Estimate the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA and IFC to:
    - identify clinically normal yearling deer infected
    - for the purpose of herd classification
    

## Study design (2 districts in NZ)

- Prevalence of MAP infection in farmed deer different in North (29%) and South Island (51%) of New Zealand - two populations
- 20 clinically normal yearling deer sampled (faeces and blood) in 20 herds SI, 18 NI

## Statistical considerations

- Samples not independent observations, clustered in herds
- Variation in within-herd prevalence expected
- Possibility of non-infected herds

## Statistical considerations

- Variation in within-herd prevalence modelled as a random effect
- Zero-inflation effect incorporated 
    - include in the model the probability of herd being non-infected

## Write down the model in STAN
- stan.R

## Get the data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load('output\\datNZ.RData')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(dat))
```

## Run STAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(rstan)

stan_dso <- stan_model(model_code = model_string)
dataList <- list(y1 = as.matrix(dat), N1 = 18)
stanFit <- sampling(object = stan_dso, 
                    data = dataList, 
                    chains = 1, iter = 9000, 
                    warmup = 1000, thin = 1)
```


## Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load('output\\blca.RData')
```

```{r}
print(stanFit, pars = c('SeELISA','SpELISA','Seifc','Spifc','phi1'))
```

## Practical
- Run the model for the two populations
